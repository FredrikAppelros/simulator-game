simulator-game
==============

A basic simulator game Ã  la SimCity. Or at least that's what I intend it to become.

The terrain generator is currently the main part of this project and it started out being based solely on Perlin noise. It has since then evolved into using the method described in [this](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/) excellent guide by Red Blob Games.
